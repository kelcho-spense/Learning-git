Typically, the developer will specify their feature branch as the source branch and the <code class="code" id="-15cks4_97">main</code> branch as the destination branch.</p><p id="-15cks4_94">After receiving the pull request, the project maintainer has to decide what to do. If the feature is ready to go, they can simply merge it into <code class="code" id="-15cks4_98">main</code> and close the pull request. But, if there are problems with the proposed changes, they can post feedback in the pull request. Follow-up commits will show up right next to the relevant comments.</p><p id="-15cks4_95">It&rsquo;s also possible to file a pull request for a feature that is incomplete. For example, if a developer is having trouble implementing a particular requirement, they can file a pull request containing their work-in-progress.

For example, if a developer was working on a feature with a teammate, they could file a pull request using the <span class="emphasis" id="-15cks4_116">teammate&rsquo;s</span> Bitbucket repository for the destination instead of the official project.
